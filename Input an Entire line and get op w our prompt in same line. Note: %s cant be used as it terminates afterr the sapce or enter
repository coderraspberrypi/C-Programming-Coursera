File Copying

Given getchar and putchar, you can write a surprising amount of useful code without knowing anything more about I/O. The simplest example is a program which copies its input to its output one character at a time. In outline,

get a character
while (character is not end file signal)
    output the character just read
    get a new character

Converting this into C gives

c_014_01
#include <stdio.h>

main() /* copy input to output; 1st version */
{
    int c;
    c = getchar();

    while (c != EOF) {
        putchar(c);
        c = getchar();
    }
}

Exercise RS-4: Write a C program equivalent to this Python program:

print('Enter line')
line = input()
print('Line:', line)


//c code but I have used FGETS() function here instead of above mentioned get and putchar. 
//strcspn returns the length of the string till the specified punctuation mark or special character "\n" in this case


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char input[100];

    printf("Enter line\n");
    fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);

    // Remove newline character if present
    input[strcspn(input, "\n")] = '\0';

    printf("Line: %s\n", input);

    return 0;
}
